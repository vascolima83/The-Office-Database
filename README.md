I have beginned learning SQL, and decided to make my first database. Since I'm a big The Office fan, tried and made a database with the main characters in it.

I have included data like:

First Name,
Last Name,
Gender,
Birthday,
Occupation;

These are some basic information, but I thought it could be interesting to include for now. I'm hoping to include more data as I work on it.

Hope you enjoy!
